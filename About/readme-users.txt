OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOLARMAZE

When the program runs you should find yourself in a maze in first person
view.  The controls you should know about are:

[UP-ARROW]: move forward
[DOWN-ARROW]: move backward
[LEFT-ARROW]: rotate camera view left
[RIGHT-ARROW]: rotate cmaera view right

[C]: drop a candle
[D]: (when standing facing a dropped candle) pick up a candle

Candles do not currently have a gameplay purpose in the program but they
can be dropped and and picked up.  Moving around the maze you will find that
you cannot wall through the maze wall, collision detection is awesome right???

Your first goal is to find one of the orange balls that are bouncing around
the maze dropping particles as they go.  Once you find one try to catch it!

After you catch a ball (there are 5 total but you only need to catch 1), then
a tractor beam will appear that can let you out of the maze.  It will move
around as well so try to find it quick.  If you walk into the tractor beam,
then you will begin to move into the air and lose control of your position. 
Once you move high enough, you will have escaped and the program will close.

Have fun!
